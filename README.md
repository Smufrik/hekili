Maintained by Smufrik. I also contribute to [Next Action Guide (NAG)](https://nextaction.guide/), a separate Classic WoW rotation-coaching project.

## Project-Wide Editing Workflow

- Rotation and priority order are edited in .simc files.
- Core spell behavior and engine logic are implemented in .lua files.
- Exception: spec-specific spell edge cases may require targeted .lua logic.
- State calls needed by APL/rotation conditions must be exposed from Lua (state expressions/functions) so .simc files can reference runtime state without moving rotation logic into Lua.
